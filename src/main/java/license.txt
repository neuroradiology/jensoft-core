JenSoftAPI Dual Licensing
-------------------------

JenSoft API has a dual licensing model with open source license and commercial licenses. 
Dual Licensing allows software companies to provide their products for either commercial*
or Open Source development. Dual Licensing is based on the principle of Fair Exchange. 
For using JenSoft API to develop applications, JenSoft requires its users to choose one 
of the following options:

 -Support the development of JenSoft API by purchasing commercial licenses.
 -Support the Open Source community by releasing their application under an Open Source license.

Although JenSoft API is a free/open source software (F/OSS) project, giving you a lot of freedom
and flexibility regarding the use of the JenSoft software, this doesn't mean you're free to do 
anything you want with the product: you have to respect the Affero General Public License.
You can be released from the requirements of the license by purchasing a commercial license from JenSoftAPI company.

JenSoft is an avid supporter of open source software. Our open source license is the appropriate option 
if you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the Affero GPL license. 
Although the Affero GPLv3 has many terms, the most important is that you must provide the source code of your 
application to your users so they can be free to modify your application for their own needs. 
Our commercial is the appropriate option if you want to use framework in commercial applications 
whose source code you want to keep proprietary.

Buying such a license is mandatory as soon as you develop commercial activities distributing the JenSoft API 
software inside your product or deploying it on a network without disclosing the source code of your own 
applications under the AGPL license. These activities include: offering paid services to customers as an ASP, 
serving Charts on the fly in the cloud or in a web application, shipping JenSoft API with a closed source product.
